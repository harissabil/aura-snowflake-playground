      "Question: How should staff handle emergency situations?\n",
      "Answer:  In the event of an emergency situation, staff should prioritize their safety and the safety of those around them by following established protocols. This includes the proper usage of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) when necessary. For medical emergencies, staff should be trained in first aid and CPR, and should call for professional medical assistance if required. In case of a fire emergency, staff should activate the fire alarm, evacuate the building using the nearest exit, and do not use elevators. Additionally, staff should be familiar with the location of emergency exits and assembly points. It is essential to follow all established emergency procedures and communicate effectively with colleagues and emergency responders to ensure a safe and efficient response.\n",
